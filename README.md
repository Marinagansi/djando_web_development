# Introduction
Rent is a convenient and cheap way to choose clothes. This is probably the number one reason people choose to rent. If people hire the clothes they can wear for at the onetime and return. No need to store them in their closet for the remaining year. Clothing rental is a sustainable alternative to the disposable style cycle of “buy, wear, replace”. It lets consumers discover unique pieces and get brands in front of consumers who may not otherwise wear them. Although it is not a one-size-fits-all approach, its applications are increasing.
