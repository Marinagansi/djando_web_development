    <h1>Dress Hire</h1>
    <p>Buying top designer brands is outrageously expensive.

        A piece of clothing can cost $60 minimum Perhaps you can buy one or two pieces in a year if your budget is not so tight.
        
        Renting, on the other hand, will let you experience top brands such as Zimmermann at $100. At this price, you will be able to afford designer clothes for all your events, meetings, or travels..</p>
